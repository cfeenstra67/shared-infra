# Shared Infra

This repository houses the pulumi configuration (using components from [stackattack](https://github.com/cfeenstra67/stackattack), my own project) for shared infrastructure resources that I reuse across my projects. Here are some of my public repos that use shared infrastructure defined in [`stack.ts`](stack.ts):
- [My website](https://www.camfeenstra.com) ([code](https://github.com/cfeenstra67/website/blob/main/infra.ts))
- [Stackattack docs](https://stackattack.camfeenstra.com) ([code](https://github.com/cfeenstra67/stackattack/blob/main/packages/docs/infra.ts))
